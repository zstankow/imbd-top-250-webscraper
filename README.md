# Scraping IMBD's Top 250 Movies List

Author: Zoe Stankowski

## Comparting time efficiency of _requests_ and _grequests_

This code extracts the movie titles and directors of the Top 250 Movies ranking on IMBD using two different libraries: requests and grequests.

The code returns the time it takes for each method, showing that using grequests is much more time efficient (in this code, batches of 10 are used).
